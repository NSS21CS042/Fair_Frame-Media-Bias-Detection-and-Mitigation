# Fair_Frame-Media-Bias-Detection-and-Mitigation
This project focuses on identifying and reducing bias in media articles. It involves two main tasks:

## 1. Bias Detection – Predicting the degree of bias in a given piece of text.

# 2. Bias Mitigation – Rephrasing biased sentences to make them more neutral and objective.

This project proposes a ML based approach to systematically detect and reduce bias in textual content, ensuring that news articles remain as neutral and objective as possible. By leveraging the power of transformer-based architectures, the system can analyze textual patterns, detect bias, and generate mitigated content with minimal human intervention. The bias detection model assigns a bias score to each piece of text, indicating the degree of bias present in the content. This score serves as a crucial metric for assessing the effectiveness of bias mitigation techniques.
